# Description 
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard application that will allow users to enter a city name, and would receive a 5 day weather forecast. Using the Open Weather Map API, we are able to retrieve the temperature, humidity, the wind speed, the UV index, along with the representation of weather conidtions. Local storage was utilized in order to save the user's input information for use after closing out the application.
